          Jesus Lives Here Church of God in Christ is a multicultural ministry
          founded by Pastor Ebenezer and Lady Veronica Spencer. Our mission is
          to equip and empower believers to live lives that are righteous and
          pleasing to God. Through powerful, in-depth Biblical teaching,
          preaching, and spiritual training, lives are being renewed and
          transformed across all walks of life. As one church in many locations,
          we are committed to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ in our local
          community—and around the world. No matter where you’ve been or how
          you’ve connected with us, you’re always welcome here. Jesus Lives
          Here—and so can you.
